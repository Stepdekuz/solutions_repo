Decomposing the motion: - Horizontal: x(t) = v0 * cos(theta) * t - Vertical: y(t) = v0 * sin(theta) * t - (1/2) * g * t^2 Solving for time of flight T (when y = 0): T = 2 * v0 * sin(theta) / g Range R: R = v0 * cos(theta) * T = (v0^2 * sin(2 * theta)) / g This formula assumes flat ground and no air resistance. Analysis of Range The range is maximized at 45\u00b0 for given v0 and constant g . Increasing v0 increases the range quadratically. On different planets (different g ), the trajectory varies accordingly. Practical Applications Sports: optimizing angles for long throws or jumps. Military: artillery range prediction. Space: analyzing launch trajectories. Limitations & Extensions Ignores air resistance: can be modeled with differential equations including drag force. Assumes level ground: terrain elevation changes require numerical solutions. Future Improvements Include wind and drag. Model projectile launched from varying heights. Use Runge-Kutta methods for precise trajectory paths. \"\"\"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#projectile-motion-analysis","text":"import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt","title":"Projectile Motion Analysis"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#constants","text":"g = 9.81 # gravitational acceleration (m/s^2)","title":"Constants"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#function-to-calculate-range-of-projectile","text":"def calculate_range(v0, theta_deg): theta_rad = np.radians(theta_deg) return (v0**2 * np.sin(2 * theta_rad)) / g","title":"Function to calculate range of projectile"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#generate-range-vs-angle-plot","text":"def plot_range_vs_angle(v0_values): angles = np.linspace(0, 90, 500) plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6)) for v0 in v0_values: ranges = calculate_range(v0, angles) plt.plot(angles, ranges, label=f'v0 = {v0} m/s') plt.title('Range vs Angle of Projection') plt.xlabel('Angle (degrees)') plt.ylabel('Range (m)') plt.legend() plt.grid(True) plt.show()","title":"Generate range vs angle plot"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#example-usage","text":"v0_samples = [10, 20, 30] # initial velocities in m/s plot_range_vs_angle(v0_samples)","title":"Example usage"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#theoretical-analysis-description-markdown-style","text":"\"\"\"","title":"Theoretical Analysis Description (Markdown style)"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#theoretical-foundation","text":"The motion of a projectile launched with initial velocity v0 at an angle theta to the horizontal is governed by Newton's laws.
